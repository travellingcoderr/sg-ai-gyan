***Langchain Overview: Components and Workflow***

Langchain enables the creation of generative AI applications by orchestrating large language models (LLMs) with tools, prompts, and integrations. The framework's workflow centers on three main components:

1. **Retrieving Data**: This involves using document loaders to access diverse sources of information.
2. **Text Chunking**: Due to LLM context window limitations, text is split into manageable chunks.
3. **Storing Chunks**: These chunks are stored as vector embeddings in vector databases for efficient semantic search.

Proper data parsing, chunking, and storage underpin the accuracy and effectiveness of AI-powered assistants and applications built with Langchain.
